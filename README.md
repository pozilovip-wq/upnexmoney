Upnex Finance &amp; Students Dashboard is a smart internal system built to manage everything in one place â€” students, payments, and expenses. It helps the Upnex team track how many students joined, who paid, when and how they paid, and who received the money. It also includes an expense section to monitor office costs and marketing budgets.
